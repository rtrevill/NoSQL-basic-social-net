# NoSQL-basic-social-net

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

This application takes the power of MongoDB, and of mongoose and integrates these technologies into what is the basis of a social network.

The application will allow users to create, delete and modify the essential components that are commonly used in social media sites.

This application will allow users to:
-   Create, modify and delete Users
-   Create, modify and delete Thoughts associated to users
-   Create and delete reactions in response to the thoughts.
-   Create associations (friendships) between users.

This application is soleley designed for back-end, and may be tested by using Insomnia or Postman.
